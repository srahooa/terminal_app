At this point I am making progress and know which direction I am heading. This is different from when I started the game and felt pretty lost. Testing my Obstacle class enabled me to properly display menus when a player reaches the main menu, a fort, or a natural feature. At this point I am working to complete the flow of the game so that a player can start and end the game. Next I would like to add a counter to display how many days between landmarks. The time log would enable bad weather and other random events to impact the total number of days it takes to travel the trail.
